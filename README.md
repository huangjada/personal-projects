# personal-projects
This is a repo for any small projects that I'm working on, no matter how miniscule it may be. I am trying to work on side projects that are not requirements for school grades,
and have always thought about doing it but never put in the effort to do so. Creating this repo is the first step for me to push myself to work on more things.

# calculator-1.py
This is the first small project that I've created. It is very basic and can be fine tuned, but currently meets the requirements I set out for myself.
The program does not end after it finishes a calculation, and instead "restarts" itself when prompted by the user. I did this so that I do not have to 
manually run the file each time I want to do a calculation, and will ask the user after the end of each calculation if they wanted to continue. The program
will end if the user declines continuing usage of the calculator.
