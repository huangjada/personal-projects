# personal-projects
This is a repo for any small projects that I'm working on, no matter how miniscule it may be. I am trying to work on side projects that are not requirements for school grades,
and have always thought about doing it but never put in the effort to do so. Creating this repo is the first step for me to push myself to work on more things.

# calculator-1.py
This is the first small project that I've created. It is very basic and can be fine tuned, but currently meets the requirements I set out for myself.
The program does not end after it finishes a calculation, and instead asks the user if they want to continue. I did this so that I do not have to 
manually run the file each time I want to do a calculation, and will ask the user after the end of each calculation if they wanted to continue using result of previous calculation, followed by if they wish to start a new calculation with new numbers. The program will end if the user declines continuing usage of the calculator.

# rock-paper-scissors.py
Spent under 30 minutes working on this. I remember coding the same game back in my first year of computer science, in my CSC 110 class. Definitely was a lot easier this time around. I haven't coded in python in a while, and re-familiarizing myself with the python technicalities was a fun process. I do still have a lot to re-learn though, such as using try-catch blocks and classes as I have not used those in a while (currently taking a lot of theory classes as of this writing).
